# Restart-on-crash supervision (mirrors the Kokoro TTS daemon).
#
# The daemon wraps non-thread-safe native libs (mlx-whisper / MLX-Metal). A
# gen_lock now serializes transcription so concurrent requests can't race the
# model, but if the process ever still dies (a malformed-audio native fault,
# OOM) we restart it so STT self-heals instead of staying dead until the next
# Relay launch — the daemon is registered --autostart only, with no
# restart-on-crash from Relay.
#
# Relay runs this wrapper as a process-group leader and stops the service by
# SIGTERM-ing the whole group (1s grace, then SIGKILL). So: run python in the
# background, wait on it, and trap TERM/INT to forward the signal, stop the loop,
# and exit promptly — well inside Relay's grace window. Only an unexpected exit
# (crash) triggers a respawn; a clean exit or a stop signal ends the loop.
